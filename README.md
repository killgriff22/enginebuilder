# Engine Generator

## This script is garbage

It just is, this is a fork of [Engine Builder](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/engine-generator)

## How to use the script

### Running the script

1. Install Python 3 on your computer if it isn't already installed
2. double click the `engine.py` script

### Using It

1. enter the amount of cylnders per bank
2. enter the amount of banks
3. enter the agles for each bank
4. you can change values based on the number provided.
5. when you want to generate it, you can either enter the number for generate<br>or you can just press enter when it prompts you to enter a number again
6. If you do not wish to change the engine name (and the file name) then just continue through it and it will loop back to the beginning.
